# Baker

An example of a CLI developed with SwiftCLI.

This example project builds a CLI called "baker". It includes three commands, one implemented in each method described in the "Commands" section of the [SwiftCLI README](https://github.com/jakeheis/SwiftCLI#commands). The commands are: `init`, `list`, and `bake`.

To run this CLI, in the project directory run `swift build` and then `.build/debug/baker bake cake`.
