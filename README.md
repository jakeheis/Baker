# Baker
An example of a CLI developed with SwiftCLI.

This example project builds a CLI called "baker". It includes three commands, one implemented in each method described in the "Commands" section of the SwiftCLI README. The commands are: init, list, and bake.

To run this CLI, in the project directory run `swift build`, and then `.build/debug/baker bake cake`.
